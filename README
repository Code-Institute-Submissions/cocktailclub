##UX
* A simple layout provides ease of use to users from the homepage
* The site is responsive across all screen sizes
* Inputs use placeholders as well as error messages in place to clearly describe what needs to be entered by user
* Light colours used on a dark background to make the content stand out and easy to read

#### User Stories
* As a user, I want to search by cocktail name, so that I can find a cocktail recipe to make at home.
* As a user, I want to be given a random cocktail recipe, so that I can get inspiration for making cocktails at home.
* As a user, I want to learn tips and tricks for making cocktails at home, so that I can prepare what equipment I need for making cocktails at home.
* As a user, I want to be able to request for a new recipe to be added to the site, so that I can find all my favourite recipes in one place.


#### Strategy
As people are spending a lot more time at home due to the current circumstances it was decided that the Cocktail Club would be aimed at those who want to re-create cocktails in the comfort of their own home. 
A simple layout was chosen to enable users to easily search for a recipe, or get a random recipe if they need inspiration.

#### Scope
It was decided that it should be very clear and simple for the user to find their desired recipe, therefor this is the main focus of the homepage. For those users who need inspiration there is also a random button that will display a random recipe.
The site also includes an Info page which gives users tips and tricks for making cocktails at home, this is not necessary but it gives the site a nice personal touch.

#### Structure
The recipe results are displayed in an easy to view grid, each with a photo and the cocktail name. Each recipe can then be expanded to view the whole recipe. In case the user is not happy with that specific recipe there is a back button to allow users to browse each recipe without having to reload the page.

#### Skeleton
Figma was used to design a wireframe, you can view it <a href="https://www.figma.com/file/RdOmB4ks8GmqkZWuD6E7LU/Milestone-1-wireframe?node-id=212512%3A0" target="_blank">here</a>

#### Surface
* The colour theme of the website was decided on so that it is eyecatching to the user but also easy to read with light text on a dark background. 
* The background image used is very minimal so that it is not a distraction from the main content. 
* The font Poppins is very easily read and is a modern font that looks nice.
